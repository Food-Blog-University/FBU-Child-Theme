**** Font Icons ****

When using the font icons, you can use different methods to insert an icon, in the order of preference:

<i class="fa fa-desktop"></i>
<div class="fa fa-desktop"></div>
<span class="fa fa-desktop"></span>

The font icons are based on "Font Awesome" which can be found here for reference:
http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/

For this theme, you have the option to install a plugin called "Font Awesome Shortcodes" which lets you insert icons from the content editor.
This theme already has the Font Awesome styles added.

Pure & Simple also includes one custom icon style that you can use like I have on the front page of the live demo:
http://demo.styledthemes.com/demos/puresimple/

To achieve this result, you need to wrap your icon in a container like this:

<span class="icon-circle">[fa type="desktop"]</span>

or, if you are inserting the icon not as a shortcode:

<span class="icon-circle"><i class="fa fa-desktop></i></span>
